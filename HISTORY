## v0.7

### Backwards Incompatible Changes

* Updated to reflect marketing change from "UI Composer" to "NVIDIA DRIVE™ Design".
  * The `UIC` module is now named `NDD`.


## v0.6.1

### New/Changed Features

* Support for the new `PathBuffer` property types (for paths that reference a `.path` on disk).
* Unsupported/invalid custom property types fall back to String (with a warning).

### Bug Fixes
* Render plugins are now lightly tested and supported.


## v0.6.0

### Backwards Incompatible Changes

* Changed `FileBacked#resolve_file_path` to `FileBacked#absolute_path`, and added `FileBacked#relative_path`.
* Removed `.errors?` and `.errors` for application and assets.

### New/Changed Features

* State machines properly report on visual actions.
  * _Only `<set-attribute>` properly implemented so far._
* Added much improved `Presentation#referenced_files`, `Application#missing_files`, `Application#unused_files`.
* Tweaked REPL output.
  * `nil` results no longer print `#=> nil` in the REPL.
  * `show` prefixes the result with `#=>`.
  * Multi-line results are now wrapped, with each line prefixed with `#=>`.
* Added beginnings of support for effects and renderplugins.
* Presentations do not cause a runtime error if a custom class (e.g. behavior, effect, custom material) cannot be found.

### Bug Fixes
* Fix bug that caused some properties to report their type as `nil` or `float` instead of `Float`.
* Presentations are slightly more capable if they are created without an existing file.


## v0.5.0 - 2014-Nov-26

* Fix bug that prevented loading an application from the command line in another directory.
* Compatibility: `FileBacked#path_to` is now `FileBacked#resolve_file_path` to prevent conflict with `Presentation#path_to`.
* Make `inspect` representation of assets more useful.
* Add convenience methods for collections of assets by type on presentations:
  `.layers`, `.groups`, `.cameras`, `.lights`, `.components`, `.models`, `.materials`,
  `.images`, `.behaviors`, `.aliases`, `.paths`, `.anchor_points`, `.texts`
* Fix bug that prevented behavior instances from having proper `name` or `sourcepath` attribute values.
* Added `.hierarchy` to presentations and assets for printing the scene graph.


## v0.4.5 - 2014-Nov-19

* Added a large amount of documentation.
* Minor code refactoring:
  * Most (internal) Presentation methods that took a scene graph element as the argument now take an asset.
  * All `FileBacked` assets now have `save!` and `save_as`.


## v0.4.1 - 2014-Nov-16

* Update `MetaData.xml` for tests to newest version.
* Source paths for images/textures normalize the path (forward slashes and no leading `./`).
* Added `app.main` as a simpler alias for `app.main_presentation`.
* Add support for paths and anchor points, including `mypath.anchors` as an array of anchor points.
* Assets present in MetaData and presentation, but not yet hand-entered into the hierarchy, now work and default to inherit from `Asset`.


## v0.4.0 - 2014-Nov-11
* Switch attribute filtering again; now all attributes are inline in the `find()` hash, and the four special keys are prefixed with an underscore: `_type`, `_slide`, `_master`, and `_under`.


## v0.3.0 - 2014-Nov-10
* Switch attribute filtering to use `attr:{ … }` instead of `attributes:{ … }`
* Attribute matching now requires that a requested attribute be present, or else the asset matching fails.
  * _For example, `main.find attr:{ diffusecolor:[nil,nil,nil] }` will now only find assets with a `diffusecolor` attribute._


## v0.2.5 - 2014-Nov-10
* Re-adds blank line after REPL result.


## v0.2.4 - 2014-Nov-10
* Fix bug with history editing in REPL (prompts no longer have a blank line before)
* Add temporary hack to make projects using Float2 load correctly


## v0.2.3 - 2014-Nov-7
* Cleaner mechanism for creating a truly blank binding


## v0.2.2 - 2014-Nov-7
* REPL shows version number when it starts


## v0.2.1 - 2014-Nov-7
* REPL mode after script maintains binding of script (all local variables remain available)
* Customized `.irbrc` files will not cause warnings


## v0.2.0 - 2014-Nov-7
* Add Presentation#save_as
* REPL working directory is same as .uia


## v0.1.0 - 2014-Nov-7
* Add REPL mode for ruic binary


## v0.0.1 - 2014-Nov-7
* Initial gem release
* Crawl presentations and modify attributes
* Batch find assets
* Save presentation changes back to disk
